# Report on KLEE-Driven Test Generation for GUI Applications
## Background and Challenges

GUI applications typically consist of two major modules: core logic and event-driven interaction. Traditional testing methods struggle to comprehensively cover their complex states. KLEE, using symbolic execution technology, can automatically explore program paths and generate high-coverage test cases. In this project, I use KLEE to generate high coverage test cases and address the following key aspects:
1.	Core Logic Testing: Symbolic testing of the program's internal algorithms and computational logic.
2.	Event-Driven Testing: Modeling and automated testing of user interaction behaviors and state transitions.


## Approach
### Core Testing Strategy

The testing framework for GUI applications can be decomposed into:
Core Logic + Event Handling Model

By symbolizing input parameters (e.g., numerical values) and event sequences (e.g., button click sequences), KLEE is enabled to generate corresponding parameters and event sequences.

### Solution

1. Core Logic Testing 
    - Use klee_make_symbolic to convert input parameters into symbolic variables.
    - Constrain input ranges using klee_assume.

2. Event-Driven Testing
    - Map GUI events to integers (e.g., Button Click→0).
    - Construct symbolic event sequences to simulate user operation flows.

## Core Logic Testing Example: Calculator Program
### Code Under Test

```c
// calculator_core.h
double calculate(double a, double b, char op);

// calculator_core.c
#include "calculator_core.h"
double calculate(double a, double b, char op) {
    switch (op) {
        case '+': return a + b;
        case '-': return a - b;
        case '*': return a * b;
        case '/':
            if (b == 0) return -999; // Error code
            return a / b;
        default: return 0;
    }
}

```
### KLEE Test Program

```c
// test_calculator.c
#include <klee/klee.h>
#include "calculator_core.h"

int main() {
    double a, b;
    char op;
    klee_make_symbolic(&a, sizeof(a), "a");
    klee_make_symbolic(&b, sizeof(b), "b");
    klee_make_symbolic(&op, sizeof(op), "op");

    // Constrain operator and input ranges
    klee_assume(op == '+' || op == '-' || op == '*' || op == '/');
    klee_assume(a >= -1e6 && a <= 1e6);
    klee_assume(b >= -1e6 && b <= 1e6);

    double result = calculate(a, b, op);

    // Verify addition commutativity
    if (op == '+') {
        double reverse = calculate(b, a, op);
        klee_assert(result == reverse);
    }

    // Verify division by zero error
    if (op == '/') {
        klee_assert(b != 0); // Implicitly verifies b!=0 is handled
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Test Coverage

| Path       | Instrs | Time(s) | ICov(%) | BCov(%) | ICount | TSolver(%) |
|------------|--------|---------|---------|---------|--------|------------|
| klee-last  | 739    | 0.45    | 73.48   | 50.00   | 328    | 30.86     |

This test achieved **73.48%** instruction coverage and **50%** branch coverage, effectively validating the core logic of the four arithmetic operations.

## Event-Driven Testing Example: Graphics Drawing Program
### GUI Event Parameterization

Map user operations to discrete event codes:
Draw_line → 0
Draw_Circle → 1
Draw_rectangle → 2

### Symbolic Event Sequence Testing

```c
#define MAX_EVENTS 10
int event_sequence[MAX_EVENTS];
int event_count = MAX_EVENTS; 

// Symbolize the event sequence
klee_make_symbolic(event_sequence, sizeof(event_sequence), "event_sequence");

// Constrain event code validity
for (int i = 0; i < MAX_EVENTS; i++) {
    klee_assume(event_sequence[i] >= 0 && event_sequence[i] <= 2);
}

// Simulate processing the event sequence
process_event_sequence(event_sequence, event_count); functions based on codes
```

### Coverage

| Path       | Instrs       | Time(s) | ICov(%) | BCov(%) | ICount | TSolver(%) |
|------------|--------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|------------|
| klee-last  | 54,887,369   | 35.06   | 98.55   | 85.00   | 276    | 5.04       |

**Coverage Analysis:** The event sequence test achieved **98.55%** instruction coverage and **85%** branch coverage, validating the robustness of complex state transitions. However, execution time increased significantly for long sequences.

## Limitations
1.	External Dependencies: GUI programs often rely on third-party libraries (e.g., GTK/Qt). Stub functions are required to isolate these library dependencies.
2.	State Explosion: Long event sequences lead to exponential growth in the number of paths. Constraints on the search space are necessary (e.g., limiting the event sequence length).


## Next Steps
1.	Practical Application: Apply this solution to xzoom to generate automated GUI test cases.
2.	Optimize Current Solution: Introduce techniques like path pruning to control state explosion.

## Conclusion
This solution demonstrates that KLEE can effectively test both the core logic and event-driven behavior of GUI applications, providing a technical method for GUI automation testing.
