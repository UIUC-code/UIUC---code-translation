## 1. Overview

This report provides scripts for analyzing and visualizing security improvements when translating C code to Rust. Through static analysisn, it detects potential security risks in C code and demonstrate how Rust's type system and ownership model address these issues.


## 2. Workflow

### 2.1 Security Analyzer (security_analyzer.py)

```bash
python3 security_analyzer.py demo.c demo.rs
```

Functionality​​:
- Analyzes security risks in C code:
    1. Dangling pointers
    2. Memory leaks
    3. Buffer overflows
    4. Null pointer dereferences
    5. Double-free risks

- Analyzes Rust security features:
    1. Ownership system
    2. Automatic memory management
    3. Error handling mechanisms
    4. Boundary safety
- Captures Rust compiler errors:
- Detects security-related compilation errors
- Generates security comparison data:
    Outputs JSON-formatted security analysis report

### 2.2 Report Generator (generate_report.py)


```bash
python3 generate_report.py
```

Functionality​​:
- Parses security analysis data
- Generates interactive HTML report:
    1. Security risk comparison charts
    2. Memory management visualizations
    3. Compiler error analysis
    4. Security feature distribution
- Creates static HTML file:
    1. Contains all visualizations
    2. Responsive design for all devices

### 2.3 Visualization Report (security_report.html)

```bash
open security_report.html  
```

Report Content​​:

- ​Security Summary​​: Key metrics card display
- Risk Comparison​​: Visual comparison of C vs Rust security risk
- Memory Management​​: Manual vs automatic memory operations comparison
- Compiler Analysis​​: Details of captured security errors
- Security Features​​: Distribution of Rust's ownership system features

## 3. Conclusion

This C to Rust security visualization pipeline provides an automated assessment of safety improvements achieved through language translation. Through static analysis, the script quantifies risk reduction and safety feature adoption, making it particularly suitable for evaluating and demonstrating the security benefits of migrating critical systems software to Rust.
